- 👋 Hi, I’m Freya / @freij92!
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT, pentesting & security, home automation, DIY, 3d printing and design and obviously much more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux! Yes I'm a total noob! Stepping away from OTS solutions and delving into the deep.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on usefull/practical, open source home automation/improvement and network solutions or products.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Hers... but lets leave binairies to the computers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: IT Business manager, thinkerer and maker, garderner and lover, yes a total waster.
